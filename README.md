## Introduction

**Goals:** 

* Practice using Hashes and Arrays
* Writing your code incrementally
* Create method for specific tasks
* Writing driver code for your methods, to test that they work correctly

## Step-by-Step Tasks

Perform the tasks below, in order, within the `state_info.rb` ruby file.

### Task 1

Insert two additional states into the `Hash`, but without modifying the initial `Hash` definition. Instead, add in these new kv pairs after the `states` object is defined.

### Task 2

Declare another hash called `cities` where the keys are again the state code but the values are arrays of city names.

Add a few (2 to 4) cities for each state.

### Task 3

Define a method `describe_state` that:

* Takes as input a state code (eg: `'CA'`)
* Returns the details of that state, including a list of its cities (eg: `'CA is for California. It has 2 major cities: San Francisco, LA'`)

**Tips:**
* The method should return the string, not output it
* Write test code to output the return value to make sure it works, like we have done with previous exercises
* Write the code incrementally:
  1. Write the empty method
  2. Write the test code after the method definition, that will actually be doing the `puts` of the method's `return` value.
  3. Implement a small part of the method instead of trying to have it return the final string. Eg: `'CA' is for California'` only.
  4. Add more functionality and test code

### Task 4

Declare another `Hash` called `taxes` which is responsible for defining taxes for each of the states (eg: `7.5` for 7.5%). You can just make up the values... though I cannot guarantee that the US Gov't will not come after you for misrepresenting their tax information.

### Task 5

Define another method called `calculate_tax` which:

* Takes as input the state code as well as a dollar amount (eg: `123.49`)
* Determines the tax rate to use based on the provided state
* Calculates the tax amount based on that rate
* Returns the tax amount rounded to 2 decimal places (eg: `44.53`)

Refer to the same tips as Task 3

### Task 6

Define a method `find_state_for_city` which should:

* Take as input the name of a city
* Return the state code for where that city is located

Of course, for your test code, find states for cities that are actually mentioned in your `cities` hash

### Bonus Tasks _(Optional)_

**Note**: Please complete the required tasks prior to attempting this bonus.

#### Task 7

Refactor your code such that instead of having two separate hashes `states` and `cities`, you would just have _one_ hash, and the information about the state name and all of its cities would be available in that one hash.

#### Task 8

Unless you've already done so previously, improve your methods to handle "edge cases" to make them more robust.

Examples:
* If an unknown state code is passed into the `calculate_tax` method it won't throw an error
* If a string state code (eg: `'MI'` instead of `:MI`) is passed into a method, it can still recognize and find the desired state
